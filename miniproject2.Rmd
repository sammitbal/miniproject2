## Task 1 - Sammit

**Question:** Explain why you should avoid using the function na.omit() to remove observations (rows) with missing data for the CODGames2_mp dataset. 



We should avoid using the na.omit function because it will remove an unnecessary amount of observations which still have valuable data in them. In this data set we have a lot of unused variables because of the types of game modes that are played in COD. Certain game modes keep track of more data than others. For example Kill Confirmed keeps track of Confirms, Denies, and Objectives. These are variables that are otherwise unused when not playing Kill Confirmed. Overall, na.omit is the wrong function to use because it does not consider the possibility that we don't need every column. We should instead use a function that removes observations based on a column by column basis.  



```{r}
apply(X = COD_dataset, MARGIN = 2, FUN = countNA)
```



## Task 2 - 2 for Jason, 1 for Thadd, 2 for Sammit

Explore 5 more variables of your choice. 

- You should explore at least one categorical and at least one quantitative variable.
- Perform a univariate exploration of each variable. (In other words, do not look at the relationship between pairs of variables. Instead, just explore each variable by itself.)

*For each variable, you should...*

1. Identify the variable, the type of variable (categorical, quantitative, etc.), 
information about the types of values the variable can take, and the amount of missing data within the variable. 
2. Report some summary statistics and make a visualization.
3. *If a variable is categorical...*
  1. Make a table of possible values and include counts or proportions. 
  2. Then, make an appropriate plot to show the distribution of values.
4. *If a variable is quantitative...*
  1. Include some basic summary stats like the mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, etc. 
  2. Make an appropriate plot to show the distribution of 
values.
5. For each variable, you should write a few sentences to describe what you have learned about the variable. Incorporate the summary statistics and comment on the amount of missingness into your discussion. Remember, the goal is not to make the plot/calculate the summaries. The goal is to use plots and summaries to gain knowledge from the data.
6. Place each discussion next to the relevant plot/summary statistics rather than writing code for all 5 variables first followed by all discussion. If you the discussions are not near the plots, it makes it difficult for your audience to follow your explanations without excessive scrolling

## Task 3 - Jason

## Task 4 - Thadd


Question: y = Result (win or loss), x = Score

- i.e. "Is the score related to the result (win/loss)?" 



How to interpret coefficients 


Step A: Exponentiate: calculate 𝑒^𝛽̂1 = 𝑒−0.0088 ≈ 0.991.

Step B: Interpret: As a person’s age increases by 1 year, we expect the odds of surviving to change by a factor of 0.991.

• Note that the explanation reads “change by” rather than “increase by” or
“decrease by”
