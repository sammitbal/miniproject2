## Task 1

**Question:** Explain why you should avoid using the function na.omit() to remove observations (rows) with missing data for the CODGames2_mp dataset. 

- NOTE: If you want to write a great answer, use the function that  we wrote in the notes for counting the number of NAâ€™s and apply that function to each row of the dataset. 
- (In the notes we applied the function to each column instead of each row.)
